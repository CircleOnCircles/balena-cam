## Additional Information

- This project uses [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) (a Real-Time Communication protocol).
- This current version uses our capture and streaming block - see these projects for more setup options!
- A direct WebRTC connection fails in some cases.
- This current version does not use mjpeg streaming when the webRTC connection fails.
- If you want mjpeg fallback, password protection or camera flip, check out the previous version of balenaCam

### TURN server configuration

If you have access to a TURN server and you want your balenaCam devices to use it, check out the setup options in the [streaming block].
